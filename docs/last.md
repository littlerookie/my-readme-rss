[ASTRA: Autonomous Spatial-Temporal Red-teaming for AI Software Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03936v1)

- ASTRA: introduces an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems, with Offline Domain Modeling (builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs), Knowledge Graph (KG) Construction (builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs), Oracle (ensemble of high-capacity reasoning models and static analysis tools), Blue-teams (ensemble of high-capacity reasoning models and static analysis tools), Monte Carlo Sampling (probabilistic sampling to explore input space), Modeling (process of creating the KG), Boundary Cases (inputs with inconclusive safety judgments), Online Vulnerability Exploration (probes input space for safety violations), Spatial Exploration (probes input space for safety violations), Temporal Exploration (analyzes reasoning processes for vulnerabilities), Target System (AI coding assistant under evaluation), Online Judge (lightweight model for real-time vulnerability assessment), Chat (interaction interface with target system), Successful Violation-inducing Inputs (identified inputs triggering unsafe behavior), Model Alignment (dataset for model alignment), Augmented Data (dataset for model alignment), and SFT+RL (fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for alignment), where it works in three stages to build knowledge graphs, explore vulnerabilities, and generate violation-inducing cases for model alignment.
- The framework focuses on discovering realistic vulnerabilities by exploring both the input space (spatial exploration) and the LLM's reasoning processes (temporal exploration) guided by knowledge graphs.
- ASTRA finds significantly more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to more effective alignment training for safer AI systems.

[Using the NANDA Index Architecture in Practice: An Enterprise Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03101v1)

- NANDA (Networked AI Agents in a Decentralized Architecture): introduces a comprehensive framework for secure, trustworthy, and interoperable AI agent ecosystems, featuring a NANDA Index/Registry (global agent discovery), AgentFacts (verifiable capability attestation), NANDA Adapter (cross-protocol interoperability), Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) (secure agent interactions), Agent Visibility and Control (AVC) (enterprise governance), Agent Router (agent interaction management), LLM (agent reasoning engine), and various Protocols (MCP/A2A/NLWeb/HTTPS communication).
- The framework addresses critical infrastructure requirements for large-scale autonomous agent deployment by enabling verifiable agent discovery, cryptographically attested capabilities, and seamless cross-protocol communication.
- NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access principles to extend traditional Zero Trust Network Access, mitigating autonomous agent security challenges like capability spoofing and impersonation attacks.

[A SURVEY OF AI AGENT REGISTRY SOLUTIONS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03095v1)

- MCP Registry: introduces a centralized metaregistry for discovering and installing MCP servers, with all its components, where it provides a centralized metadata layer using structured mcp.json files for agent discovery and installation.
- This framework uses GitHub-authenticated publishing and structured metadata for server discovery, minimizing attack surface by delegating authentication to proven systems.
- Its schema-driven core service and decoupled metadata hosting ensure operational simplicity and ease of upgrades.

[BlockA2A: Towards Secure and Verifiable Agent-to-Agent Interoperability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01332v2)

- BlockA2A: introduces a unified multi-agent trust framework with an Identity Layer (decentralized identity management), a Ledger Layer (immutable auditability/data integrity), a Smart Contract Layer (programmable interaction rules/access control), and a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) (proactive threat detection/response), designed to enable secure and verifiable agent-to-agent interoperability.
- The framework addresses key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, such as fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts.
- It eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions, with empirical evaluations demonstrating its effectiveness in neutralizing various MAS attacks.
